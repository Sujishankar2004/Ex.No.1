## 1.Aim: Comprehensive Report on the Fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)

###  1.1 Definition  
Generative AI refers to algorithms that can generate new data like text, images, music, or code. These models learn patterns from existing data and synthesize new, realistic outputs.

###  1.2 Types of Generative Models
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Two networks (generator + discriminator) compete to produce realistic outputs.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** Encode data into a latent space and decode to generate new samples.
- **Transformers:** Advanced models using self-attention to generate highly contextual sequence data (like text).

###  1.3 Key Techniques
- **Self-Attention:** Enables the model to focus on relevant tokens in a sequence.
- **Latent Variables:** Represent input data in compressed form for diverse output generation.

###  1.4 Training Paradigms
Trained on massive datasets using loss functions to reduce the difference between generated and actual data. Includes unsupervised and semi-supervised techniques.
